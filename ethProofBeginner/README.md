# bangacoin
bangacoin is a simple smart contract written in Solidity that allows users to mint and burn tokens.

## Token details
The token name is bangacoin and the token symbol is BC. The total supply of tokens is initially zero and can be increased or decreased by calling the mint and burn functions respectively.

## Contract functions
The contract has two public functions:

mint(address user, uint amount): This function allows anyone to create new tokens and assign them to a user address. The amount parameter specifies how many tokens to mint. The function updates the total supply and the balance of the user accordingly.
burn(address user, uint amount): This function allows anyone to destroy existing tokens from a user address. The amount parameter specifies how many tokens to burn. The function requires that the user has enough balance to burn the specified amount. The function updates the total supply and the balance of the user accordingly.
Usage example
To use this contract, you need to deploy it on a compatible blockchain network, such as Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain. You can use tools like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat to compile and deploy the contract.

Once deployed, you can interact with the contract using web3 libraries or web interfaces. For example, you can use Remix to call the mint and burn functions with different parameters and see how they affect the total supply and the balances of different addresses.

You can also use tools like Etherscan or BscScan to verify the contract source code and view its transactions and events on the blockchain.
